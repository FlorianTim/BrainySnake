# How to contribute?

Any kind of contribution is welcome as a pull request. If you are unsure on how to fork a repository and then create a pull request from your fork, please read this [blog post](https://reflectoring.io/github-fork-and-pull/) for a quick guide.

## Pick an Issue
You can pick any issue from the [issue tracker](https://github.com/adessoAG/BrainySnake/issues). We try to document all feature ideas, tasks and bugs as issues in the tracker. Issues marked with the tag "up-for-grabs" are preferred to be added in the next version, and therefore are higher prioritized. You might want to start with one of those tasks. You can just as well pick any other task, though. If you have any questions, get in touch. Code and Documentation should be in english.

## Submit an Idea
If you have an idea, submit it to the [issue tracker](https://github.com/adessoAG/BrainySnake/issues) for discussion. We will let you know our thoughts. If you want to develop your idea yourself, you can do so and submit a pull request. Please mark your new task with the "idea" tag.

## Documentation
Please keep documentation up-to-date when changing the code. Documentation is made up of the following elements:

* README.md file
* Javadoc: please provide sensible javadoc of at least public API
